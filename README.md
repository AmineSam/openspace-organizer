# OpenSpace Organizer
[![forthebadge made-with-python](https://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)


## üè¢ Description

BeCode has recently moved to a new office at CEVI Ghent, featuring an open workspace with 6 tables of 4 seats each. To help everyone get to know their new colleagues better, we introduced a daily seat rotation system ‚Äî so team members sit next to different colleagues each day.

This project implements a Python script that automatically reassigns everyone to a new seat every day. The script ensures that seating arrangements are randomized while maintaining balanced distribution across tables, encouraging collaboration and interaction among all students.

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ table.py

## üõéÔ∏è Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2 .To run the script, you can execute the `main.py` file from your command line:

```
   python main.py
```

3. The script reads your input file, and organizes your colleagues to random seat assignments. The resulting seating plan is displayed in your console and also saved to an "output.csv" file in your root directory. 

```python
from utils.file_utils import read_names_from_csv
from utils.openspace import Openspace


def main() -> None:
	"""
	Main function that runs the Open Space Organizer.

	This function:
	1. Reads colleague names from a CSV file.
	2. Creates an OpenSpace with tables and seats.
	3. Randomly assigns people to seats.
	4. Saves the final seating plan to an output file.
	5. Displays the results in the terminal.
	"""
	input_filepath = "new_colleagues.csv"
	output_filename = "output.csv"

	# Step 1: Read all colleague names from the input CSV
	names = read_names_from_csv(input_filepath)

	# Step 2: Create an OpenSpace (6 tables √ó 4 seats)
	open_space = Openspace(number_of_tables=6, table_capacity=4)

	# Step 3: Randomly assign colleagues to available seats
	open_space.organize(names)

	# Step 4: Save the seating plan to a file
	open_space.store(output_filename)

	# Step 5: Display the assignments in the console
	open_space.display()


if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()

```
## üñºÔ∏è Visuals

Below is an example of the seating plan generated by the script when it runs:
Each day, the program assigns everyone to a new seat across six tables with four seats each, ensuring a mix of colleagues and encouraging collaboration.
